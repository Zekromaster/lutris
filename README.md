# Lutris
Personal fork of Lutris. Refer to base repo for stuff I haven't changed.

## General

### Disabled Loading Screen

I just removed the "Lutris is starting" screen, don't like it, I can personally live with lutris taking a couple seconds to boot my game without any progress bar on screen.

## Yuzu

### Changed Version to Mainline

Yuzu now uses the mainline version, latest at time of download.

### Added "Fullscreen" Option

There's now a "Open game in fullscreen" option for Yuzu, that calls the emulator with the `-f` flag.
